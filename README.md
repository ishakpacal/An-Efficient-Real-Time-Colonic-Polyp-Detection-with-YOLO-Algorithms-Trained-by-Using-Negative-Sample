# An-Efficient-Real-Time-Colonic-Polyp-Detection-with-YOLO-Algorithms-Trained-by-Using-Negative-Sample

This is a real time polyp detection work based on YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 trained on large publicly available datasets (Endoscene, PICCOLO and SUN Polyp Database)

Repo will be updated soon. 

Source codes, models and descriptions will be added after publication of the paper.
